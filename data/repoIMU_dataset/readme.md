abstract="In this paper, we describe the freely available repository, RepoIMU, proposed for the needs of orientation estimation algorithm evaluation for inertial motion capture systems. Such algorithms fuse data from IMU sensors - accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope. Although such systems gain in popularity, the evaluation of methods used in their development is still not well covered in literature. In presented repository, unlike many others, signals from IMU sensors combined into easily interpretable kinematic chain are synchronized, and not only cropped to, reference orientation obtained from accurate optical motion capture system.",
